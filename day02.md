### Retro Bubbles

Full and empty circles are arranged in a grid and given random diameters.

### Exploding Cube

I was inspired by [Refik Anadol's Grid Studies](https://www.behance.net/gallery/8070375/Generative-Sketches-()-Grid-Studies). I wanted to create a similar effect in 3D space.

Same size spheres are arranged in a cubic grid. A random point within the grid is chosen. From that position an increasing diameter pushes away the surrounding spheres.
