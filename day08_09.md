# Day 08 & 09

## Finalizing

I chose two of the previous projects to continue working on - one from the very beginning and one from the very end of the course.

### Filter

I continued working on the circle filter and made it interactive. In this version the section around the cursor is scaled down. Due to performance issues, it is only interactive in full screen like the next work.

{% endraw %}

The closer the cursor the more distorted the circle at that part. If the cursor is close enough, the line overshoots to the other side.

I decided to make this idea from day 02 react to music.
