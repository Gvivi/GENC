# Day 03

## Clock

### Cubic Clock

Inspired by the cubic grids of the previous day, this clock gains one row of small boxes per second along the x-axis, per minute on the y-axis, and per hour on the z-axis. The saturation changes for boxes created after every 15 minutes. The brightness changes for boxes created after every 6 hours.

### Minimalistic Calendar

The outer circle represents the years of the century, the middle circle represents the months of the year, and the inner circle represents the days of the month. Changing numbers of days in a month, including leap years, were considered.
