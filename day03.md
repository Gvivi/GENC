# Day 03

## Clock

### Cubic clock

Inspired by the cubic grids of the previous day, this clock gains one row of small boxes per second along the x-axis, per minute on the y-axis and per hour on the z-axis. The saturation changes for boxes created after every 15 minutes. The brightness changes for boxes created after every 6 hours.

### Minimalistic calendar

The outer circle represents years of the century, the middle circle represents months of the year and the inner circle represents days of the month. Changing numbers of days in a month including leap years were considered.
