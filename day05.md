# Day 05

## Reflect / Collect / Prepare

### Exploding Illustration

Since I enjoyed the grids I wanted to continue an idea that I started there. I wanted to recreate the exploding cube I did as a 2D project. So it would resemble a illustration like the reference by Refik Anadol I mentioned on day 02 does.

### Noise Cube

I have never used the noise function before, so this was meant to get a bit familiar with that. It could prove useful in later creations.
